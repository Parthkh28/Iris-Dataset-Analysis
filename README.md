# Iris Dataset Analysis and SVM
Today we are going to focus on a classification problem in which we are given the data of Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa and Iris Virginica. These 3 species of flowers look very similar physically and it is difficult to differentiate them even with human eyes. We are going to apply SVM to this problem to predict Iris species type.

## Iris dataset is having 4 features of Iris flower and one target class.

The 4 features are :

- **SepalLengthCm**
- **SepalWidthCm**
- **PetalLengthCm**
- **PetalWidthCm**                        



The flower species type is the target class and it is having 3 types :

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**
